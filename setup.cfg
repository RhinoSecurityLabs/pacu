# The setup configuration file.
# https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/configfile.html
#
# The setup configuration file is a useful middle-ground between the setup scriptâ€”which, 
# ideally, would be opaque to installers and the command-line to the setup script, 
# which is outside of your control and entirely up to the installer.
# In fact, setup.cfg (and any other Distutils configuration files present on the target system) 
# are processed after the contents of the setup script, but before the command-line.
